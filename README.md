# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Some improvements I would implement in the future include mobile web optimization, some elements do not translate well on smaller screens. Another improvement would be clickable menu items to dispaly details about each product ex. nutrietion facts etc.
